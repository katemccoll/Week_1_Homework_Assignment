# Week 1 - Homework

*Market Agency are wanting their website up to date.
Needs to follow the accessibility standards*

## Header: 

Line 11: Change div to header. This is the header on the website. 

Line 26 to change as well to suit.

Line 12: There is span, I will change this to em. Unsure about this, but after some googling, it looks like the right thing to put here.
Saved and checked. The font has now changed to italic. Which is what we don't want. Back to googling! There are a lot of sites that are just saying to use span. Will leave this for now.

Line 13: Change to nav. These are our navigation tools in our headers.
In the class selectors "headers", that have divs next to them. Change the div to nav. Save. They are now in line.
Our headers class is no longer needed. We can now change this to an element selector by removing the period in CSS and removing the class in HTML.
Header Completed.

There is a lonely div under header. It is class selector for an image. Changing this to img. When I saved and viewed, the nav bar when under where it should. Not acceptable. Section worked! There is also a class selector called hero. The selector is not used anywhere else. Will Change this to an id. After having a think about this, I am going to change it back to div. As it is more of a divider than a section.


## Main Content: 
We are now getting to the main part of the website. Therefore changing the first and last div to main. 



## Section: 

Within the main (parent), we have three different sections. So changing these div to sections to represent this. 
So all three sections has a class for each different area of the company. The last two have id. In the style sheet, there is ony one id which is the one I created. The class is not needed here as it is not being used by multiple html elements. We will change these to ids here and make the changes in the CSS. Wait, in the CCS, the are making changes to the image as well in a different one. Leave this as class and remove the id tags from the other two. Nope! That did not work. Both are needed.
Oh! I have added and id="search-engine-optimization". This had solved an issue I saw at the start. When you click the nav link, it did not automatically move down. Now it does. That solves why the id tags are there!


Back to having both id and class in the sections. I have decided to remove the class and have ids for each of them. They have put a class here for each section, but it is only being used once. In this case, changing it to ids. Saved and checked. Yes, still worked! 

## Aside: 
I have changed the last group of divs to aside as it is content that is placed on the sidebar. Children divs I have changed to sections.
Each section has a class. Once again, this is only being used one time. I have changed them to ids. 
Saved, check, it works


## Img: 
Adding Alts to all img
Cost management photo has a ending /img, this isn't needed as it is a self closing tag.


## Title: 
Currently the title is "Website", changing this to have a more descriptive title.

## Footer: 
Line 83: Change div to footer. Have taken out the class then removed the period from both footer codes in CSS. Have made them into an element selector.
Saved and Open. Working correctly.

Last minute add sorry!
I realised as I was looking over code in class, I forgot to add the heading comments in the html.
